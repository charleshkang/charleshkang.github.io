# My Professional Website


<p>Created using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and the wonderful base theme, <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/">Grayscale</a>, I made my first professional website.</p>

<p>This also serves as my first but certainly not last, passion project for the Access Code 2.2 program.</p>

<p>Photo of the mountains were taken by me, Charles Kang. Please feel free to share, use, and implement the photo yourself if you would like, just please remember to credit me!</p>
