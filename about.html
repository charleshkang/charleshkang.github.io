    <p id="aboutBlurb">I'm an iOS developer in the Access Code 2.2 Fellowship at <a href="http://www.c4q.nyc/">Coalition for Queens.</a> I used to work in the restaurant industry, working as a cook, bread baker, and barista. Cooking and the entire hospitality industry was not something I could see myself doing for my entire life, and I realized it wasn't for me. I found C4Q extremely luckily, and here I am today, 2 months away from finishing the 9-month intensive program. <br /><br />

      I will be starting my job hunt very soon, and I want to help create tech that helps people. Apps should not only make people's lives easier, but better! My goal is to land a job as a junior developer at Spotify, because music is a core part of who I am. Not to mention that their HQ is located in Sweden, and I love traveling.
