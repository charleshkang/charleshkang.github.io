    <p id="aboutBlurb">I'm an iOS developer in the Access Code 2.2 Fellowship at <a href="http://www.c4q.nyc/">Coalition for Queens.</a> I used to work in the restaurant and hospitality industry. I've worked as a cook, bread baker, and barista. Working in the hospitality industry was not something I saw myself doing long term, so I searched and searched for something I've always loved, tech! I'm now exactly 3 weeks from finishing the Access Code program, and I couldn't be more excited to begin my career as a junior developer! <br /><br />

      As a junior developer, what I am looking for most in new companies is to grow and find awesome mentors to learn from. I absolutely love to travel and companies with headquarters or offices around the world is a gigantic plus. Creating thoughtful and wonderful designs with great UI and UX is another passion of mine, and it's also something I do as a hobby.
