    <p id="aboutBlurb">
      I graduated from the Access Code program at <a href="http://www.c4q.nyc/">Coalition for Queens earlier this year.</a> I'm a professionally trained chef, and have worked in many sectors of the hospitality and restaurant industry. I still love to cook, but mobile development is something I could see myself doing long term with more success and passion.

      As an iOS Developer, I'm looking for companies that put emphasis on mentorship, great code reviews, efficient stand ups, pair programming, and a fun yet challenging environment. I also love design, so equal love for both technical and design aspects of an app is very important to me.
